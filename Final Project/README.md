## Data Visualizations of Interest

1. The article ["Connecting music and big data"](https://news.umich.edu/connecting-music-and-big-data/) explains how data science is being used to bridge the gap between language and music. It talks about projects that create tools to generate musical interpretations of texts based on their content & emotional tone, offering new ways to experience and interact with literature and other forms of written content.
2. Here's a network graph of how different individuals are related in Game of Thrones. ![Game of Thrones Family](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdist.neo4j.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fexample-viz.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=fd895b293f78d7be4786129a718ec061c08b8beb819cd57f3f300b3a8e3d9e8e&ipo=images)
   Game of Thrones is one of my favorite series and I've always been fascinated by the intricate story line. I like network graphs because they're very relevant to computer science and can reveal interesting relationships between topics.

| A database of graphic novels          |           The Graphic Narrative Corpus includes graphic novels, memoirs, jounalism, and fantasy comics aimed at adult readers. It contains novels from the mid-1970s to 2017. Coding can help parse and analyze the metadata associated with these texts to understand trends across different regions, and NLP techniques would further allow us to analyze the textual content including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, etc to explore narrative techniques.           | [Graph Novels Dataset](https://groups.uni-paderborn.de/graphic-literature/gncorpus/corpus.php) |
| Surveillance technology around the US |                                            This database documents the deployment of surveillance technologies by law enforcement agencies across the US. Coding allows us to conduct geospatial analysis with which researchers can map the distribution of surveillance tech across different jurisdictions. We can use network analysis to analyze the relationships between law enforcement agencies and technology providers.                                            |                                       [Atlas of Surveillance](https://atlasofsurveillance.org) |
| A database of Scottish witchcraft     | The dataset contains records of nearly 4000 individuals accused of witchcraft in early modern Scotland. Coding can help us perform complex searches to reveal patterns in accusations, trial outcomes, and societal contexts. For example, we can automate searches for a specific theme such as accusations related to demonic possession. Coding also allows us to create visual representations to illustrate the geographical distribution of witchcraft cases over time. |                                            [Scottish Witchcraft](https://witches.hca.ed.ac.uk) |

## About Me

Hi, my name is Shivani and I'm currently a _rising junior_ studying **Computer Science**. I wanted to take Digital Humanities 140: Coding for Humanities because I was interested in seeing how programming ties in with analyzing data trends in humanities-related research questions. DH101 gave me a taste as we delved into researching & constructing a narrative on a dataset of our choice, but I wanted to see how we could use programming to achieve our goals in this course.
