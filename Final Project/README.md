## Topic Description
The "Top Intelligent People in the World" dataset from Kaggle offers a detailed look at 5,000 of the world's most intelligent individuals, consisting of their names, countries, fields of expertise, IQ scores, notable achievements, awards, educational backgrounds, and influential contributions. While primarily focused on intellectual accomplishments and personal data, this dataset has significant relevance to the humanities. 

It can reveal trends and patterns in intellectual achievements across different cultures and historical periods. This analysis can offer insights into how social, political, and cultural contexts influence intellectual development. Additionally, the dataset's information on notable works and influential contributions is important for understanding the impact of these individuals on society and culture. Overall, it serves as a comprehensive resource for studying the lives, achievements, and impacts of some of the world's most intelligent people, providing opportunities for rich analysis within the humanities and beyond.

## Questions of Interest
- How did historical and cultural factors influence achievements brought forth by the recorded individuals?
- Which fields of expertise do the most intelligent people excel in? Are there certain professions or areas of study that attract high IQ individuals more than others?
- How has the recognition and distribution of high intelligence changed over time? Are there historical periods that produced more recognized geniuses?
- Is there a correlation between IQ scores and the level of achievement or impact these individuals have had in their respective fields?
- What are the demographic patterns amongst the top intelligent people? Are there commonalities in age, gender, nationality, or educational background?
   - How do highly intellectual women compare to highly intellectual men?
- What environmental factors (e.g. socioeconomic status, educational background, cultural influences, etc) are common amongst these individuals? How do these factors influence the development of high intelligence?

## About Me

Hi, my name is Shivani and I'm currently a rising junior studying Computer Science. I wanted to take Digital Humanities 140: Coding for Humanities because I was interested in seeing how programming ties in with analyzing data trends in humanities-related research questions. DH101 gave me a taste as we delved into researching & constructing a narrative on a dataset of our choice, but I wanted to see how we could use programming to achieve our goals in this course. This project has allowed me to do just that.
