    "text": "The dataset title “Top Intelligent People in the World” offers an interesting glimpse into the academic lives and achievements of some of the most intellectually gifted individuals across the globe. This dataset provides detailed records of 5,000 leading minds on various aspects including their names, professions, contributions, and IQ scores. This project aims to ascertain how the educational background of some of the world’s most intelligent people influenced their fields of expertise and the types of achievements they attained while also exploring other motivations.\n\n\nI was also particularly interested in understanding how we could characterize intelligence in addition to quantitative measures such as IQ, and what different factors could contribute to high intelligence. Such factors could include education, environment, personal interests, and more. This dataset includes individuals from the year 1900 to 2000, which offers us the opportunity to explore how different cultures and time periods have cultivated intelligence. We can further explore how historical and cultural factors influenced intelligence and the achievements brought forth by the recorded individuals. Since the dataset includes both male and female individuals, we can further analyze how historical perspectives coupled with educational opportunities offered affected the intelligence/contributions of women compared to men. The dataset further includes the individuals’ country of origin, which can shed light on the educational resources available in each country and how these resources may have impacted the number of highly intelligent individuals it produced or the types of achievements they attained.\n\n\nAmongst the above motivations that drive my exploration of this dataset, below are some of the questions that I seek to address:\n\n\n\nWhich fields of expertise do the most intelligent people excel in? Are there certain professions or areas of study that attract high IQ individuals more than others?\n\n\nHow has the recognition and distribution of high intelligence changed over time? Are there historical periods that produced more recognized geniuses?\n\n\nIs there a correlation between IQ scores and the level of achievement or impact these individuals have had in their respective fields?\n\n\nWhat are the demographic patterns amongst the top intelligent people? Are there commonalities in age, gender, nationality, or educational background?\n\n\nWhat environmental factors (e.g. socioeconomic status, educational background, cultural influences, etc) are common amongst these individuals? How do these factors influence the development of high intelligence?\n\n\nThese findings will primarily be revealed in our preliminary analysis."

IQ Distribution Between Genders\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset consists of 5,000 individuals and their names, country of origin, field of expertise, IQ, achievements, birth year, gender, notable works, awards, education, and influence. The dataset contains 5,000 non-null values in every column except for “Awards,” which has 3,751 non-null values. This discrepancy may be due to individuals not having received any awards, or the data could be missing as well. We also need to address the limitations of this dataset when trying to answer our questions. For example, if we are trying to compare individuals’ achievements between genders, we need to take into account the gender distribution. Analysis would be skewed if the dataset contains a disproportionate amount of men and women. Though the dataset’s only numeric columns consist of IQ and Birth Year, we can convert the Gender column by assigning its “Female” and “Male” values, 0 and 1 respectively when conducting further analysis. For example, if we were to try to predict the field of expertise based on factors such as IQ, Birth Year, and Gender, we can convert its categorical values to numerical values to better apply an ML algorithm.   Preliminary analysis showed that the IQ values noted of these individuals ranged from 130 to 200, with a mean of 164.75 and a uniform distribution (Figure 1) and the Birth Year ranged from 1900 to 2000. Figure 2 indicates that there is an uniform distribution of individuals recorded per 20 years over the course of a millenia, which may aid in providing more reasonable inferences when analyzing change over time. Figure 3 shows us that there is an even number of women and men present in the data, which allows us to make more accurate comparisons. Further exploratory data analysis indicates a large number of people originating from the United Kingdom in the dataset – 2,235 to be exact – while six other countries make up the remaining records (Figure 4). Figures 5.1 and 5.2 present a similar mean IQ value and mean birth year across different fields of expertise, showing that the average IQ of people was more or less the same across all the fields of study. It’s interesting to note that the Engineering field had the lowest mean birth year, while Biology had the highest mean birth year. This might suggest that intelligent people in Engineering were born in the earlier part of the century, whereas those in Biology were born in the latter part of the century."

    "text": "Conclusion\n\nA lot of the preliminary analysis plots showed fairly uniform distributions across different measures, but this might simply indicate that this is a highly curated dataset. However, this does not imply that our results are without value. Figure 2 indicates that certain time periods didn’t produce more intelligent people and that the distribution of people recorded remained fairly uniform over time. However, it’s important to note that this isn’t a definitive indication as 5,000 individuals is simply a small sample of a much larger population. Figure 4 indicates that the United Kingdom has the most number of intelligent people. It also shows that besides the United States, other individuals in the dataset originated from other European countries, which might be due to the fact that European countries had the best research facilities in the 20th century that allowed for STEM advancements, or it might indicate a clear bias in the dataset.  Deeper analysis into the achievements, notable works, education, and influence of these individuals proved to be interesting. The quantum revolution of the 20th century was evidently the result of many of these brilliant minds. Many experimental and theoretical physicists began to test the limits of manipulating matter on the atomic scale, bringing forth the emergence of new technologies, all dependent on quantum physics (Prawer, 2018). Technologies such as semiconductors and computers, lasers and communications, MRIs, PET imaging, etcetera all arose thanks to quantum computing and quantum mechanics. Figure 7 supports this as most of the individuals in this dataset had achievements in “Quantum Mechanics”, and further in “Quantum Electrodynamics”, and “Quantum Theory.” Additionally, Figure 8 presents that many notable works stemmed from Quantum Theory, and Figure 9 furthers the sentiment that the frequency of notable works in quantum theory increased over time. This is evidenced by the fact that as more bright individuals were born, the more quantum-related notable works were produced.  Textual analysis of notable works shed insights into what field was prominent in the 20th century. The words “Dirac” and “Quantum” appeared the most. The latter we have covered, but the former is part of the notable work, “Dirac Equation”. Discovered by the theoretical physicist Paul Dirac, who set work to look for “pretty mathematics,” the equation reconciled “two seemingly contradictory characteristics of the world” revealed in experiments in the first quarter of the twentieth century: the ability of atoms to behave as both localized particles and as spread-out waves (Chown, 2023). Furthermore, this historical period showed a high frequency in attaining Ph.D.’s in Physics and Mathematics (Figure 10). Figure 11 simply promotes these findings as it shows the top 10 areas of influence heavily include those in quantum and modern physics. Additionally, it can be inferred that the large number of Nobel Prizes attained were likely in physics and mathematics, which were prominent fields in that time period (Figure 12).  Moreover, “Cosmos” was the third most common word in notable works. In addition to physics, discoveries in astronomy revolutionized our view of the cosmos. Einstein’s general theory of relativity, though sidelined from the mainstream of physics during the early part of the century, proved vital to astronomers’ new theories about our universe. The universe was not limited to the Milky Way and was bigger than anyone thought (Rees, 2020). What’s interesting, and also quite obvious, is that both physics and astronomy went hand in hand to help these brilliant individuals make the breakthroughs they made. Similarly, mathematics and physics both also played a part, underscoring the interdisciplinary nature of many of the advancements brought about by them. This dataset was very eye opening about the impact that many men and women have had in the way society thinks about the world.  I applied a clustering algorithm on the numerical features of the dataset to see if I could identify any relationships or patterns that may not have been immediately obvious in our dataset. I hoped to group individuals based on their IQ, birth year, and gender, which might have given us insights into how these features correlate and form distinct groups. Though the clusters visualization shows the different clusters formed, we can see they aren’t densely clustered in any one area, indicating that it isn’t capturing any stark patterns in the data. I additionally trained a random forest classifier to predict the field of expertise an individual in the dataset would have based on IQ, birth year, and gender. Though most of the fields had very low precision, recall, and f1-scores, the model had higher precision (0.43) and recall (0.55) for the “Physics” class, indicating that it performed better for this category compared to others. This result is unsurprising considering what has been discussed thus far. I also performed linear regression on the dataset to try to predict the IQ of individuals based on their birth year, gender, and education type; however, the resulting root mean squared error of 20.5 indicates what the average root squared difference between the predicted and the actual IQ values is. Since the IQ values range from 130 to 200, the average error might be substantial, suggesting that the model’s predictions were not very accurate.  While we clearly saw many notable accomplishments in STEM fields, also evident by everything we know as a society today, there is so much more that can be done with such a dataset. We can derive insights to help policymakers and educators develop educational programs to maximize its contributions to society by exploring beyond the dataset. Other intriguing motivations could include exploring the overlap between intelligent people and their influence on pop culture. How many of these individuals have been portrayed in movies or TV shows? What sort of fictional characters have been inspired by real-life geniuses? We can explore if these historical geniuses shared peculiar habits or eccentric behavior. We can also further investigate how these individuals have shaped modern technology and everyday life, and so much more."
